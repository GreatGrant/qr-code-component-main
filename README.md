## My process
I started by building the structure of the webpage, then adding various CSS styles to different sections.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I was able to center a div without using CSS flexbox
To see how you can add check the code snippets below:

```html
<div class="container">Container to be centered</div>
```
```css
.container {
    margin: 50px auto 50px auto;
}
```
I also learnt to to add curved edges using CSS ```border-radius``` property.
### Continued development
I'll  be learning CSS flexbox and Grid box.
